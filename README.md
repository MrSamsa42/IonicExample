# IonicExample

The Cordova contacts plugin has been deprecated.  See https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts 
and https://cordova.apache.org/news/2017/11/27/Deprecation-of-cordova-contacts-plugin.html

This simple app was put together for purposes of testing that the plugin still works on iOS 12 and Android P for retreiving and diplaying
basic contact info.
